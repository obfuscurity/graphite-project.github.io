        <p>Want to try out Graphite? Installing any software can be a burden when you just want to give it a trial run. That's why one of the Graphite developers created the <a href="https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize">Synthesize</a> project.</p>

        <p>Synthesize is a fully automated installation and configuration script for the Graphite stack. It was initially designed as a guide for new users, demonstrating how to install Graphite manually, but evolved into a bespoke deployment mechanism in its own right. Although Synthesize targets Ubuntu 14.04 LTS specifically, it includes a Vagrantfile to allow anyone to easily and painlessly try out Graphite on their laptop or development system.</p>

        <p>The Synthesize installation includes the following software components:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Graphite-web (using Apache webserver)</li>
          <li>Carbon</li>
          <li>Whisper</li>
          <li>Memcached (caching service used to speed up data queries)</li>
          <li>Statsite (high-performance StatsD implementation)</li>
          <li>Collectd (host and service metrics agent)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Running in DigitalOcean</h3>

        <p>If you're a <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">DigitalOcean</a> customer, deploying Graphite is literally as easy as clicking the <strong>Install on DigitalOcean</strong> button below. You'll have the option to change the default instance size (512MB) or region (New York 3). For most users the default are fine. Accept the <a href="http://synthesize-do-install.herokuapp.com/terms">terms</a> and click the <strong>big blue button</strong> to launch your own Graphite instance.</p>

        <h3>Running in Vagrant</h3>

        <p>Synthesize's Vagrant script launches a small Ubuntu 14.04 LTS virtualbox instance on your host. Once this is fully booted it will run the Synthesize <a href="https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize/blob/master/install">install</a> script. Depending on your internet connection this process will usually finish in under five minutes.</p>

        <hr/>
        <pre>
$ wget https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd synthesize-master/
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
$ vagrant up
$ open https://127.0.0.1:8443/
        </pre>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Installing in an existing Ubuntu 14.04 LTS host</h3>

        <p>In some cases you may prefer to install Synthesize manually with the provided <a href="https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize/blob/master/install">install</a> script. Running these commands will install the Graphite stack on your host in an unobtrusive manner (git source checkouts in <tt>/usr/local/src</tt>, installation in <tt>/opt/graphite</tt>).</p>

        <hr/>
        <pre>
$ wget https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize/archive/master.zip
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd synthesize-master/
$ sudo ./install
        </pre>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Uninstalling Synthesize</h3>

        <p>If you deployed Synthesize to a new DigitalOcean or Vagrant instance, you can simply destroy the host. If you need to remove Synthesize from an existing server, just run the provided <a href="https://github.com/obfuscurity/synthesize/blob/master/uninstall">uninstall</a> script in your Synthesize source directory.</p>

        <hr/>
        <pre>
$ cd synthesize-master/
$ sudo ./uninstall
        </pre>
        </hr>
